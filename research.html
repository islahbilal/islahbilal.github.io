	    <p align="justify">(with Bar Light)</p>

            <p align="justify"> We offer a novel framework for analyzing a wide range of large dynamic economies with heterogeneous agents and aggregate shocks, emphasizing the role of foresight. Our approach is flexible, encompassing previous frameworks for heterogeneous agent dynamic economies. Incorporating behaviorally motivated concepts such as bounded rationality and dynamic inconsistency, our framework simplifies the agents’ optimization problem, resulting in a computationally tractable approach to solving for general equilibrium. We explore how foresight influences decision-making and equilibrium outcomes. Our comparative statics analysis reveals that foresight significantly affects the variation in endogenous equilibrium variables, distinguishing our findings from traditional risk aversion or precautionary savings effects. This variation stems from a feedback mechanism between individual decision-making and equilibrium variables, highlighting how increased foresight leads to greater non-stationarity in agents’ decisions and, consequently, in aggregate state variables.

            <a href="uea_presentation.pdf">Slides</a>

	
	    <p align="justify"> This paper studies the consumption-smoothing consequences of ownership of automobiles as an asset that is used to commute to work. By making use of high-frequency household level banking data from the United States, I document the size and frequency of out-of-pocket automobile expenses and estimate the costs of inability to self-insure when alternative transportation is costly. I show that households with low liquid wealth struggle to finance these expenses directly and must reduce consumption while also carrying credit card balances similar in magnitude to the out-of-pocket expense shock itself. Furthermore, I suggest reasons as to why the existence of present-bias can motivate failure to privately save and insure against these shocks. I show that large welfare gains exist from either extending targeted credit to low wealth households at the time of emergency automobile expenses or indirectly via the existence of public transport infrastructure. Overall, this raises the question of the efficiency of urban policy that results in high automobile ownership for households of low financial wealth due to the riskiness of automobile operating costs. </p>
